                Atia Bear is a cute little cub who loves to cuddle and sleep.
                Along with her sister Corti, she loves long walks, playing in
                the outdoors, and growling at strangers. Most of the time Atia
                likes to sleep outdoors, but every now and then she sneaks
                inside to get a snooze. She loves treats and toys, her favorite
                toys have squeaky sounds which she loves to chew open and
                completely destroy.
              </p>

                Atia is 2 years old. She lives in Suwanee, Georgia. Right now
                she is hibernating but will be out and about any time this month
                or early April. Both, Atia and Corti, love summertime, it's
                their favorite time of the year. They lay down on the sun and
                try to catch a tan, but its hard when your fur is black.
