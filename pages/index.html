            <p>
              Atia Bear is a cute little cub who loves to cuddle and sleep.
              Along with her sister Corti, she loves long walks, playing in the
              outdoors, and growling at strangers. Most of the time Atia likes
              to sleep outdoors, but every now and then she sneaks inside to get
              a snooze. She loves treats and toys, her favorite toys have
              squeaky sounds which she loves to chew open and completely
              destroy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atia is 2 years old. She lives in Suwanee, Georgia. Right now she
              is hibernating but will be out and about any time this month or
              early April. Both, Atia and Corti, love summertime, it's their
              favorite time of the year. They lay down on the sun and try to
              catch a tan, but its hard when your fur is black.
