# HW02-Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a website using bootstrap components and recreate a portfolio website to be similar to the attached images in the assets folder. We were given a screenshot of the three pages in (980; 768; 640) screen sizes and were directed to mimic the pages to look as similar to images as possible. 

I began by recreating the larger (980) designs for all 3 pages. First, I linked to bootstrap CSS and to a secondary local style.css changes to the elements. Second, I built the html files to include all the proper information. Third, I linked the css and used the inspect selector to see what properties needed to be changed and what rules to follow. Finally, I edited the style.css to better fit the colors, sizes and layouts of the webpages. 

After all the links, image sizes, font styles, buttons, and forms were properly working. I began to work on the responsive features in order to make sure that the pages followed the rules for each given image. In hindsight, I should have cited the responsive features before working so much on the style.css in order to make this task easier to accomplish. It took a lot of time and trial & error to get the images and layouts to look like the images attached, but I managed to get them looking the same. 

The end result of each page is almost identical to the images described in the homework; however, the responsive feature for the images is not working as it should have if I planned accordingly from the beginning. I know now that the beginning of my next project needs to be thought out clearer rather than starting from the html structure and working my way up, maybe I should work outline my idea and see how I can save time by using the predefined bootstrap stylesheets and responsive design. After all was said and done, I learned a lot from this homework assignment. It will definitely help me plan out future html/css tasks.
